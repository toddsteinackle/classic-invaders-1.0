If you are installing on Cygwin you will have to pass the --datadir install
location to configure, for example:

$ ./configure --datadir=c:/cygwin/usr/local/share

It can be any directory you prefer but it has to be in the format above:
drive specifier, colon, and forward slashes for path separators.
